### FAQ

#### What is smart-contract?
> Self executing program hosted at blockchain. For example in the TON blockchain every wallet is smart-contract.
> Smart-contract have state and persistent storage, which can contain any sort of variables.
> Smart-contract can store data, move funds to other smart-contracts, compute something.

#### How to start using or developing smart-contracts?

To begin with, you must pay attention to two existing programming languages related to developing smart contracts in TON: [FunC](https://ton.org/docs/#/func) and [Fift](https://newton-blockchain.github.io/docs/fiftbase.pdf). FunC is used to write the logic of contracts, it is compiled to fift-asm code, which can then be translated to bytecode for TVM. The functionality of Fift is very wide. To begin with, fift-asm is an [Asm.fif](https://github.com/newton-blockchain/ton/blob/master/crypto/fift/lib/Asm.fif) program that allows you to translate asm-like(fift-asm) code into byte code for TVM. We also use Fift to automatically test and write queries to smart contracts.

You can get the binaries of the FunC compiler and the Fift interpreter by building code from [newton-blockchain/ton](https://github.com/newton-blockchain/ton) repo.

You can use [toncli](https://github.com/disintar/toncli) to easily and conveniently develop smart contracts using FunC and Fift, especially useful if you are a beginner. The [tonweb](https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb) library is available for writing web interfaces. The official [documentation](https://ton.org/docs/#/docs) can also help you a lot.

### About TL-B

TL-B (Type Language - Binary) serves to describe the type system, constructors, and existing functions. For example we can use TL-B schemes to build binary structures associated with the TON blockchain. Special TL-B parsers can read schemes to deserialize binary data into different objects. (definition from the [documentation](https://github.com/tonuniverse/TL-B-docs))
